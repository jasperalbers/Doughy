Doughy is a simple Swift app that lives in the menu bar and provides quick access to stats of your batter(y).
It is designed to mimic the interface of the native battery monitor as closely as possible, while providing some extra functionality.

## Installation

1. Select the latest release and download `Doughy.app.zip`.
2. Move `Doughy.app` to your Applications folder and launch it.

*Since I don't have an Apple Developer Account, the app cannot be verified. As such, you need to go to `System Settings` -> `Privacy and Security`, scroll down, and allow `Doughy` to be launched.*
